The presence of backflow at open boundaries, boundaries where a natural boundary condition is prescribed, may cause the numerical simulation to become unstable. This can be seen graphically in \autoref{fig:instab}. 
\begin{figure}[t]

\caption{Example of numerical instability due to backflow\label{fig:instab}}
\end{figure}
This instability is consistent in that in the presence of backflow there is a lack of general well-posedness results for the incompressible Navier-Stokes equations \cite[429--430]{alfioquarteroni2014}: \begin{align}\label{eq:NSeq}\begin{split}
 \rho\partial_t\bmu + \rho(\bmu - \textbf{w})\cdot\nabla\bmu - 2\mu\nabla\cdot\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) + \nabla p &= 0\quad\text{on}~\Omega \\ \nabla\cdot\bmu &= 0\quad\text{on}~\Omega \\
 \bmu &= \bm{\phi}\quad\text{on}~\Gamma_D\\
 2\mu\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)\bmn - p\bmn &= \bm{\psi}\quad\text{on}~\Gamma_N
 \end{split}\end{align}
 where \mathm{\rho} is the density, \bmu~is the background flow of the fluid, \textbf{w} is the flow of the domain, \mathm{\mu} is the viscosity, \mathm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)} is the strain rate tensor and \mathm{p} is the pressure. \mathm{\Omega \subset \mathds{R}^d}(with \mathm{d} = 2,3) is the entire domain, \mathm{\Gamma_{D}} is the boundary with the Dirichlet boundary condition, \mathm{\Gamma_{N}} is the boundary with the Neumann boundary condition and so \mathm{\partial\Omega = \Gamma_{D}\bigcup\Gamma_{N}}. 
 
 \section{Energy Estimate}
 To see the instability issue, \autoref{eq:NSeq} can be rewritten while also assuming that \mathm{\phi} and \mathm{\psi} are \mathm{\bm{0}}. We take the first equation of \eqref{eq:NSeq} and dot each term with the flow, \bmu, and following that we integrate over the entire domain:
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:NSenergy1}
     \fint\rho\partial_t\bmu \cdot \bmu + \fint\rho\bmu\cdot\nabla\bmu \cdot \bmu - 2\mu\fint\nabla\cdot\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) \cdot \bmu + \fint\nabla p \cdot \bmu = 0.
 \end{equation}
 
 \noindent Noting that \mathm{\partial_{t}\norm{\bmu}^2 = \partial_{t}\qty(\bmu\cdot\bmu) = \partial_{t}\bmu\cdot\bmu + \bmu\cdot\partial_{t}\bmu = 2\qty(\partial_{t}\bmu\cdot\bmu)} and similarly that \mathm{\nabla\norm{\bmu}^2 = 2\qty(\nabla\bmu\cdot\bmu)}, we can then rewrite the first and second terms of \eqref{eq:NSenergy1}:
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:NSenergy2}
  \frac{\rho}{2}\partial_{t}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 + \frac{\rho}{2}\fint\bmu\cdot\nabla\norm{\bmu}^2 - 2\mu\fint\nabla\cdot\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) \cdot \bmu + \fint\nabla p \cdot \bmu = 0
 \end{equation}
 To proceed, the third and fourth term of \eqref{eq:NSenergy2} will need to be rewritten. First consider the integrand of the third term of \eqref{eq:NSenergy2}:
 \begin{align*}
     \qty(\nabla\cdot\stresstens)\cdot\bmu &= \sum_j \qty(\nabla\cdot\stresstens)_{j}\bmu_{j} \tag*{Writing out definition of dot product}\\
        \intertext{We can also use the fact that for any matrix \mathm{A}, the \mathm{j}-th element of the divergence of \mathm{A} is the divergence of the \mathm{j}-th column of \mathm{A}. Thus we have:}
        &= \sum_j \qty(\nabla\cdot\stresstens^{j})\bmu_{j} \tag*{Where \mathm{\stresstens^j} is the \mathm{j}-th column of \mathm{\stresstens}}\\
        &= \sum_j \sum_i \qty(\pdv{\stresstens^j_i}{x_i})\bmu_j \tag*{Expanding def. of divergence}\\
        &= \sum_j \sum_i \qty(\pdv{\stresstens_{i,j}}{x_i})\bmu_j \tag*{Rewriting the index notation}\\
        \intertext{Here we can note that by the product rule: \mathm{\pdv{}{x_i}\qty(\stresstens_{i,j}\bmu) = \pdv{}{x_i}\qty(\stresstens_{i,j})\bmu + \pdv{}{x_i}\qty(\bmu)\stresstens_{i,j}}. We can then substitute this into the equation:}
        &= \sum_j \sum_i \qty(\qty(\pdv{}{x_i}\qty(\stresstens_{i,j}\bmu_j)) - \qty(\pdv{\bmu_j}{x_i})\stresstens_{i,j})\\
        &= \sum_j \sum_i \qty(\pdv{}{x_i}\qty(\stresstens_{i,j}\bmu_j)) - \sum_j \sum_i \qty(\pdv{\bmu_j}{x_i})\stresstens_{i,j} \\
\end{align*}
The first term is clearly the divergence of \mathm{\stresstens\bmu} however the second term is not immediately obvious. Consider however the following matrix multiplication of \mathm{\stresstens\nabla\bmu}:\\
\[
\begin{bmatrix}
\sum_{j}\stresstens_{1,j}\nabla\bmu_{j,1} & \sum_{j}\stresstens_{1,j}\nabla\bmu_{j,2} & \hdots \\
\sum_{j}\stresstens_{2,j}\nabla\bmu_{j,1} & \sum_{j}\stresstens_{2,j}\nabla\bmu_{j,2} & \hdots \\
\vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots
\end{bmatrix}
\]
from which we can see that second term is actually the trace of the above matrix, and thus:
\begin{equation*}
\qty(\nabla\cdot\stresstens)\cdot\bmu = \nabla\cdot\qty(\stresstens\bmu) - \stresstens\bm{:}\nabla\bmu
\end{equation*}
where for matrices \mathm{A} and \mathm{B} the double dot product \mathm{A\bm{:}B = \text{trace}\qty(AB)}. Taking a domain integral across all terms yields:
\begin{align}
    \fint\qty(\nabla\cdot\stresstens)\cdot\bmu &= \fint\nabla\cdot\qty(\stresstens\bmu) - \fint\stresstens\bm{:}\nabla\bmu \notag\\
            &= \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\qty(\stresstens\bmu)\cdot\bmn - \fint\stresstens\bm{:}\nabla\bmu \tag*{using divergence theorem}\\
            \intertext{Finally using that due to \mathm{\stresstens} being symmetric, we can write \mathm{\qty(\stresstens\bmu)\cdot\bmn = \inner{\stresstens\bmu}{\bmn} = \inner{\bmu}{\stresstens^T\bmn} = \inner{\bmu}{\stresstens\bmn} = \qty(\stresstens\bmn)\cdot\bmu} and so:}
            &= \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\qty(\stresstens\bmn)\cdot\bmu - \fint\stresstens\bm{:}\nabla\bmu \label{eq:stresstensByParts}
\end{align}
The third term of \eqref{eq:NSenergy2} has now been rewritten, and for the fourth term we can similarly note that \mathm{\nabla\cdot\qty(p\bmu) = p\nabla\cdot\bmu + \qty(\nabla p)\cdot\bmu} therefore:
\begin{align}
    \fint\qty(\nabla p)\cdot\bmu &= \fint\nabla\cdot\qty(p\bmu) - \fint  p\nabla\cdot\bmu \notag\\
                    &= \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\qty(p\bmu)\cdot\bmn - \fint  p\nabla\cdot\bmu \tag*{using divergence theorem}\\
                    &= \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\qty(p\bmn)\cdot\bmu - \fint  p\nabla\cdot\bmu\label{eq:pressureByParts}
\end{align}
 We can now substitute \eqref{eq:stresstensByParts} and \eqref{eq:pressureByParts} into \eqref{eq:NSenergy2}:
 \begin{multline}\label{eq:NSenergy3}
     \frac{\rho}{2}\partial_{t}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 + \frac{\rho}{2}\fint\bmu\cdot\nabla\norm{\bmu}^2 + 2\mu\fint\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) \bm{:} \nabla\bmu\\ - \fint p\nabla\cdot\bmu - \int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\qty(2\mu\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) - p\mathbf{I})\bmn \cdot \bmu = 0
 \end{multline}
 From \eqref{eq:NSeq} we know that \mathm{\nabla\cdot\bmu = 0}, thus \mathm{\int_{\Omega} p\nabla\cdot\bmu = 0} and it was assumed that \mathm{\bmu = \bm{0}} on \mathm{\Gamma_D} thus the boundary integral in \eqref{eq:NSenergy3} becomes an integral only over \mathm{\Gamma_N}, however from the other boundary condition we assumed that \mathm{\psi = \bm{0}}, and so the entire final term of \eqref{eq:NSenergy3} is 0. Finally noting that \mathm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) \bm{:} \nabla\bmu = \bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu) \bm{:} \bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)} we have that:
 
 \begin{equation}\label{eq:NSenergy4}
     \frac{\rho}{2}\partial_{t}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 + \frac{\rho}{2}\fint\bmu\cdot\nabla\norm{\bmu}^2 + 2\mu\fint\norm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)}^2  = 0
 \end{equation}
 Applying integration by parts to the second term of \eqref{eq:NSenergy4} yields:
 
  \begin{equation}\label{eq:NSenergy5}
     \frac{\rho}{2}\partial_{t}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 - \frac{\rho}{2}\fint\nabla\cdot\bmu\norm{\bmu}^2 +
     \frac{\rho}{2}\int\limits_{\partial\Omega}\bmu\cdot\bmn\norm{\bmu}^2 +
     2\mu\fint\norm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)}^2  = 0
 \end{equation}
 After reordering terms and again noting that \mathm{\nabla\cdot\bmu = 0} and that \bmu~is 0 on \mathm{\Gamma_D} gives us the desired result:
 
\begin{equation}\label{NSeqENergy}
\partial_t\frac{\rho}{2}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 = -2\mu\fint\norm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)}^2 - \underbrace{\frac{\rho}{2}\bint\bmu\cdot\bmn\norm{\bmu}^2}_{(\text{\large \textasteriskcentered})}
\end{equation}
The term ({\large \textasteriskcentered}) has been particularly highlighted because it is this term which causes the instability when trying to solve \autoref{eq:NSeq} with open boundaries. It is this term that must be countered in order to obtain stable solutions.
\todo[inline]{Give the weak form of the Navier-Stokes and then go to the discrete case. Also note that the problem comes from the continuous case and is inherited by the discrete case and the aim is to stabilise the discrete case}

The equations however will not be solved analytically, as in general this is not possible for the Navier-Stokes equations, but rather wil be solved numerically using for instance a finite element method. To this end, a weak formulation of \eqref{eq:NSeq} \todo[inline]{Review the spaces for u and p} is required. The problem then becomes to find \bmu~\mathm{\in\mathbf{V}}and \mathm{p}~\mathm{\in\mathbf{Q}} such that \cite[433]{alfioquarteroni2014}:
\begin{align}\label{eq:NSweak}
\begin{split}
    \rho\inner{\partial_t\bmu}{\bmv}_{\Omega} ~+~
    \mu\inner{\nabla\bmu}{\nabla\bmv}_{\Omega} ~+~
    \rho\inner{\qty(\bmu\cdot\nabla)\bmu}{\bmv}_{\Omega} ~&-~\\
    \rho\inner{p}{\nabla\cdot\bmv}_{\Omega} ~-~
    \rho\inner{\bmu}{\bmv}_{\Gamma_N} ~&=~ 0 \qquad \forall~\bmv~\in~\mathbf{V}\\
    \inner{\nabla\cdot\bmu}{\textbf{q}}_{\Omega} ~&=~ 0 \qquad \forall~\textbf{q}~\in~\mathbf{Q}
\end{split}
\end{align}
where the usual inner product \mathm{\inner{\bm{s}}{\bm{r}}_{\chi} = \int_{\chi} \bm{s} \cdot \bm{r}} and the following sub-spaces of the Lebesgue function space \mathm{L^2\qty(\Omega)} of square-integrable functions on \mathm{\Omega} are used:
\begin{align*}
\mathbf{Q} &:= \begin{cases}L^2_0\qty(\Omega) = \qty{\bmv \in L^2\qty(\Omega) : \inner{\bmv}{1}=0} & \Gamma_N = \emptyset,\\
L^2\qty(\Omega) & \Gamma_N \neq \emptyset,\end{cases}\\
H^1\qty(\Omega) &= \qty{\bmv \in L^2\qty(\Omega), \partial_i \bmv \in L^2\qty(\Omega), 1\leq i \leq d},\\
\mathbf{V} &:= H^1_0\qty(\Gamma_D;\Omega) = \qty{\bmv \in H^1\qty(\Omega), \bmv_{|\Gamma_D} = 0}.\\
\end{align*}
% Using the weak form, a discretised \todo{add discretised form}
The weak form as defined in \eqref{eq:NSweak} inherits the instability from the continuous case, and so when we try to solve the Navier-Stokes equations using a numerical method, we also need to take into account this instability and this is done by modifying and adding terms to the equations in order to counteract the instability.

\section{Backflow Stabilisation}
Up to date, several proposals to overcome this issue of backflow instability have appeared in literature, mainly consisting in modifying the natural boundary conditions in order to enhance the overall stability \cite{bertoglio2017}. Two main methods, Velocity Penalisation and Tangential Derivative Penalisation will be considered as well as a variant of the Tangential Derivative Penalisation. 
\subsubsection{Velocity Penalisation}
The Velocity Penalisation method relies on counteracting the energy of ({\large \textasteriskcentered}) by modifying the natural boundary condition where backflow occurs with \cite{bertoglio2016}:\includecomment{Find a different source}
\begin{align}\label{eq:VeloPenal}
    2\mu\bm{\varepsilon} (\bmu)\bmn - p{\bf n} ~{\color{red} + ~\beta\frac{\rho}{2}\abs{\bf\bmu\cdot n}_{-}\bmu} = {\bf g}_{N}, \qquad \beta \leq 1
\end{align}
which would result in the addition of the following term to \autoref{eq:NSweak}:
\begin{equation}
    S_{Vel} = \beta\frac{\rho}{2}\bint\abs{\bmu\cdot\bmn}_{-}\bmu\cdot\bmv
\end{equation}
This adjustment however has the issue that accuracy is affected by the extra term, especially since the outflow is perturbed by counteracting the backflow. 
\subsubsection{Tangential Derivative Penalisation}
The Tangential Derivative Penalisation method plays on the idea of rather stabilising the local derivative of where the backflow occurs by adjusting \autoref{NSeqENergy} with:  
\begin{align}\label{eq:TangPenal}
\partial_t\frac{\rho}{2}\fint\norm{\bmu}^2 = -2\mu\fint\norm{\bm{\varepsilon}(\bmu)}^2 - \frac{\rho}{2}\bint\bmu\cdot\bmn\norm{\bmu}^2 ~{\color{red}- ~\frac{\rho}{2}\bint\gamma\norm{{\bf t^{\text{T}}\nabla}\bmu}^2}
\end{align}
This adjustment seems to have a lower accuracy impact as compared to the Velocity Penalisation method \cite{bertoglio2017}. 

\section{Problem Description}
The common trend among these methods is that they both rely on a free parameter, \mbeta~for the Velocity Penalisation method and \mgamma~for the Tangential Derivative Penalisation methods. There are values for both of these parameters for which stability has been proven, however it can also be seen experimentally that there are values for these parameters where the solution is stable and better accuracy is observed \cite{bertoglio2014}. \autoref{fig:velocompare} and \autoref{fig:presscompare} show a comparison of both methods as well as how the solution can become more accurate when taking a different value for the parameter where stability is not guaranteed, and furthermore \autoref{fig:flowcompare} shows how both methods compare when simulation the velocity profile on real geometry.\\

\\
Since the parameter must be chosen by the user before computation of the solution begins, the problem arises that if the parameter is chosen incorrectly, i.e. the solution becomes unstable, then the entire computation would have to be redone with a different parameter wasting all the previous computation time. How then should this parameter be chosen such that stability is maintained while improving the accuracy of the solution? Thus the focus in this paper will be to investigate how these two parameters can be chosen automatically during the computation such that stability is maintained while getting as accurate a solution as possible.\, which leads to the following research question: "Can these parameters be automatically chosen either at the beginning of- or during the computation such that stability is maintained while possibly improving the accuracy of the solution".

\section{Possible solutions}

The approach that will be taken will be to investigate how stability is dependent on the parameters and if it is possible to find some form of stability criterion against which the parameters can be checked to see whether backflow instabilities could occur. This would then be a key step in the automation process as once we have a sufficient condition for stability, we will be able to use this condition during the automated parameter selection procedure.\\
\\
Furthermore we would like to investigate the different stabilisation methods and to ensure whether they are able, by themselves, to completely stabilise the backflow by some choice of the parameter. This would then alter how complex their automation process would be, as if they are unable to completely stabilise the backflow instabilities then other terms might have to be considered which would take additional computational time, and thus potentially making the automation not viable. Following that investigation, the actual algorithms for automating the parameter selection will be formulated for each of the considered methods, if applicable.
