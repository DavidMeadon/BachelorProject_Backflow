    \begin{frame}{Conclusion}
        \begin{itemize}
            \item Backflow can change at every time-step, so cannot automate the parameter at the beginning of the computation to be lower than the already found stable values.
            \item Tang. Penalisation Max will have stability for a large enough gamma, irrespective of any other stabilising terms.
            \item Tang. Penalisation cannot stabilise by itself, for any value of gamma, and may rely on other stabilising terms to prevent instability.
            \item Similarly, below \(\beta = 1\), the Velocity Penalisation cannot prevent instability by itself
        \end{itemize}

    \begin{frame}{Whats more to be considered?}
    \begin{itemize}
        \item Try to understand why the Tang. Penalisation will not be stabilised for a large enough gamma.
        \item Try to include the other stabilising terms, such as viscosity.
    \end{itemize}
